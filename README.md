## Multiplier Calculation

The game uses a sophisticated multiplier system:

Bomb Multiplier = 1.5^(Bombs - 1)
Final Multiplier = Base √ó Bomb √ó (1 + Diamonds Revealed √ó 0.2)
```

**Examples**:
- 4x4 grid, 2 bombs: ~2.3x base multiplier
- 5x5 grid, 5 bombs: ~4.8x base multiplier
- 6x6 grid, 8 bombs: ~8.2x base multiplier
